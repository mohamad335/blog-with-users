our project is to add authentication by flask-login to blog project 
first we create forms of login and registers and create second database for the data of it
then we hash the passwordand check if the user has been registered before and if check password if correct or not 
then we allow only first id to create a blog post and the other can't by using decorated function
and we still have to allow users to write comments 
we need to allow user to create a many of plog so we create one to many realation between the User database and PlogPost the parent is the User so create the relation bye using sqlalchemy friegnkey and relationship
ok here we r=create a table database for comment
we create the relationship between comments and user and blogpost 
then we allow the user to make a post only the users who login
finally we add images for all user who comment by use gravatar from flask-gravtar
